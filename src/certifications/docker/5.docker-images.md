# Creating containers from Docker images

If we're trying to create containers for our own apps, instead of using dockerhub, we create our own images using docker files.

Here is the [Dockerfile reference](https://docs.docker.com/reference/dockerfile/)

## Example Dockerfile:

```
FROM ubuntu

LABEL maintainer="Carlos Nunez <dev@carlosnunez.me>"

USER root

COPY ./entrypoint.bash /

RUN apt -y update
RUN apt -y install curl bash
RUN chmod 755 /entrypoint.bash

USER nobody

ENTRYPOINT [ "/entrypoint.bash" ]
```

## Creating image from Dockerfile

```
docker build -t our-first-image .
```

The only required option with this command is the path or url to the project, which in this case is just the current directory `.`. 

`-t` allows us to tag the project for later reference.

## Building container from image

Then we simply build from the image

```
docker run our-first-image
```
