# Container interaction

If our Docker project is a server, for example, then `docker run` will create an interactive terminal session.

Exiting this session will be difficult as Docker won't recognise typical commands like `ctrl+c` to close the server.

To control a container, we can use certain Docker commands like `docker kill` that will kill the container.

For example:

```console
docker ps
```

Will list our containers, for e.g let's say we have one with the id `fcd21a720ad4`, we can kill this process:

```console
docker kill fcd
```

We can also run a container, but does not attach a terminal to it:

```console
docker run -d our-server
```

`-d` stands for detach and will just run the container as a background process.

If we want to run a command in the running container we can use `exec` [https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/container/exec/](https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/container/exec/)

```console
 docker exec 874 date
```

Let's say you want to open a shell within your container:

```console
docker exec --interactive --tty 874 bash
```

## Stopping and removing containers

Docker does not stop and remove containers for you.

To stop a container:

```console
docker stop [CONTAINER_ID]
```

This stops containers gracefully, but for a quick stop you can use:

```console
docker stop -t 0 [CONTAINER_ID]
```

`rm` removes one or more containers and it will remove it from `docker ps -a` as well.

```console
docker rm [CONTAINER_ID]
```

`rm` will not stop running containers unless you add `-f`.

To remove *all* containers, you can take output of `docker ps -a` and feed it to `rm`:

```console
docker ps -aq
```

This gives us just the ids of our containers.

Feed it to `xargs`:

```console
docker ps -aq | xargs docker rm
```

## Stopping and removing images

listing images:

```console
docker images
```

To remove images:

```console
docker rmi [IMAGE_ID]
```
