# Using Docker

We'll be using the Docker CLI for setting up and confuring docker.

## Creating Docker container

Containers are created from container images. Images are a compressed and pre-packaged file system that includes:

1. Your app
2. App environment
3. App configuration
4. Instructions for starting the application, i.e *the entry point*

When creating a container, you must specify an image locally, if there is no local image, Docker will try and pull an image from Dockerhub.

For example a simple helloworld app:

## The long way

```console
docker container create hello-world
```

This creates a container, but doesn't start it:

```console
docker ps
```
This shows containers running. You'll see no containers running.

```console
docker ps --all
```

This will show all containers, including those not running. The `hello-world` app should appear, which we can then start:

```console
docker container start 
```

To run logs and see what happened for this particular container, take the container id (or first 3 letters) and run:

```console
docker logs 9af
```

To attach the output to the terminal run:

```console
docker container start --attach 9af
```

## The short way

`docker run` bundles all the above commands into one:

```console
docker run hello-world:linux
```

```
docker run =
docker container create
+ docker container start
+ docker container attach
```
