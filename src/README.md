# Introduction

Welcome to my wiki, this is where I document my learning, including notes on certifications and courses I take, programs I use and workflows I re-use.

I believe in creating a central repository for your knowledge, instead of relying on external services to consume tidbits of information. By collating and documenting what I learn, it helps my synthesise information and have persistent reference points written and maintained by me.

It is built using [mdBook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/), which is a really great CLI for generating books/wikis from markdown files.
