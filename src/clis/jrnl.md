# Jrnl

Jrnl lets you journal from the command line.

To add an entry:

```console
jrnl Went to church. It was divine.
```

This will store an entry for today. "Went to church" will be the title (anything up to . is considered the title)

To see journal entries for today:

```console
jrnl -on today
```
